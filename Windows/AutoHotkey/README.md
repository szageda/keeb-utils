# Keeb Utils – AutoHotkey

> *AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: form fillers, auto-clicking, macros, etc. Define hotkeys for the mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons and autocorrect-like replacements.*

— *www.autohotkey.com*, AutoHotkey, [link](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> An alternative solution to AutoHotkey on Windows is [KMonad](/Linux/KMonad/README.md#windows).

## Requirements

- **AutoHotkey v2.0**: Ensure you have the latest version of AutoHotkey installed. The scripts may run on AutoHotkey 1.0, but they are likely to behave incorrectly.
- **Windows 7.0+**: Windows 10 and 11 are guaranteed to be compatible. These scripts are tested on modern Windows environments.

## Installation

1. **Download the scripts**: Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. **Run the main script**: Navigate<b>*</b> to `keeb-utils-main\Windows\AutoHotkey` and double click `keeb-utils.ahk`

<b>*</b> If you downloaded the repository, extract the archive first.

## Usage

The scripts run in the background. You can see the AutoHotkey icon (replaced by the project's) in your system tray when AutoHotkey is running. If you want to quit AutoHotkey, right click the system tray icon and select *Exit*.

> [!NOTE]
> To use Keeb Utils in all windows, you must run AutoHotkey as an Administrator. Otherwise, the script cannot control applications that have elevated privileges.
